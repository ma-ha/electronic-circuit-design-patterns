# Electronic Circuit Design Patterns

This is a collection of basic building blocks for electronic circuits.

It is *NOT* about single electronic components.

## Beginners Hint

Mostly circuit design starts and ends with a [power-supply](power-supply/README.md). 
Seems simple ... it's not!

You might also need [filter](filter/README.md) or [protection](protection/README.md) circuits.
