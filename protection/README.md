# Protection Circuit Design Patterns

This is a collection of basic building blocks for electronic circuits.

# Burn out protection

# Fuse
 
Fuses cuts the supply of the circuit in case of over-current. 
Over-current can be caused by overload, shortages or malfunction of circuit parts. 

The fuse must be placed in the beginning of the circuit.
