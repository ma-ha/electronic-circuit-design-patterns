# Power Supply Design Patterns

This is a collection of basic building blocks for electronic circuits.

All circuits need a power supply.
Even if this is external, it's not done connection a Vcc and GND cable.

- Battery charger
- Current source 
- Decoupling capacitors
- HV generation circuits
- Separated supplies (analog/digital)
- Symmetric power supplies
- Transformator + rectifier

# DC-DC Converter

- Linear Regulator
- Zener diode
- Switch mode power supply
  - Buck converter
  - boost converter
  - Buck-boost
  - Fly back
  - Cuk
